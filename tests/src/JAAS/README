This is a framework for testing JAAS security. The default is the 
Krb5LoginModule, but other modules can be used easily by editing
the server/conf/jaas_test.conf. 

The JAASRealm is a tomcat specific artifact. Mileage on other 
containers will indeed vary.

Building:
Run 'ant archive' on the commmand line.

Deploying:
- Stop tomcat
- copy server/conf/jaas_test.conf to ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf
- Edit catalina.sh (or sysconfig/tomcatx) & add the following line to JAVA_OPTS
-- JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.auth.login.config=$CATALINA_BASE/conf/jaas_test.conf"

- copy jaas_test.war to ${CATALINA_BASE}/webapps
- Start tomcat
- http://localhost:8080/jaas_test should produce the login page
